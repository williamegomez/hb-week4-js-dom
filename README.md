# hb-week4-js-dom
This exercise will help you to understand how you can interact with the DOM API using Javascript to acomplish different common tasks in a user interface.

- Create a simple gallery that dynamically put contents in it where:
  - The user can navigate between the images using:
    - Arrows in the UI
    - Dot indicators in the UI (optional)
    - Keyboard arrows (optional)
  - Images appear and disappear using `opacity` and `transition`
  - Disable arrows when there are no more images.
  - The gallery should be responsive using the breakpoints described below (you can use the large image for all the viewports and use CSS to resize it).
- Create a page that dynamically put contents in it where:
  - The menu should be dynamically populated with categories of cards
  - Clicking in a menu item should filter items in the grid
  - A collection of cards should be dynamically populated inside a grid
  - Each card should be able to flip in order to see more content
  
Both exercises should support at least a small, medium and large viewports.
- Small: 0 - 639px
- Medium: 640px - 1023px
- Large: 1024 - âˆž

## IMPORTANT
SASS support and BEM syntax are NOT optional.
